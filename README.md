Hello, I am sharing my project with you today. It's about Google Chrome sessions. You might have noticed that whenever we forcefully close Chrome and reopen it, a 'Restore Pages' button appears at the top-right corner. This button allows us to restore the tabs we were working on before they were abruptly closed, which could be a serious privacy threat if those tabs contained sensitive data. The fact that private data or sessions can be restored with just the Ctrl + Shift + T shortcut is concerning.  To address this issue, I created a Python program that deletes all those sessions. If you think you were working on something sensitive in your browser and don't want an attacker or anyone else to access it, just run this program on your system. It will automatically close Chrome and delete all sessions. After the program completes, when you open Chrome again, you'll still see the 'Restore Pages' button, but this time, clicking it won't load the pages because there are no sessions available. Even the Ctrl + Shift + T shortcut won't work.
